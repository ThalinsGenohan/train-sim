## Otter Train Sim

Just a thing I decided to make because I like Factorio's train mechanics, but couldn't find anything similar that I liked.

Suggestions and pull requests for organization, style, etc are *very* welcome.

Included in `train-sim/lib/` is a copy of [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) 2.5.1 built for Windows 64-bit, because that's what I'm building with, and I have no idea how to actually set up a C++ repo properly for multi-platform support. Again, suggestions and pull requests, very welcome.

Also CMake is awful and I hate it thanks
